          <span id="S">S</span>rinvasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician who lived from 1887 to 1920. He is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, and his work has had a profound impact on the field of mathematics.
          Ramanujan was born into a poor family in Madras, India. He showed an early aptitude for mathematics, and he began to study on his own. 
          In 1913, Ramanujan wrote to the British mathematician G. H. Hardy, describing his mathematical work. Hardy was impressed by Ramanujan's work and invited him to come to Cambridge University to study mathematics. Ramanujan arrived in Cambridge in 1914 and worked with Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood for the next five years.
          During his time at Cambridge, Ramanujan made significant contributions to the theory of numbers. He proved many new theorems and developed new methods for solving mathematical problems. Ramanujan's work was so impressive that he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1918.
          Ramanujan returned to India in 1919, but his health began to decline. He died of tuberculosis in 1920 at the age of 32.
